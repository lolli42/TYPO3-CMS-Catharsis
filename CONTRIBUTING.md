Contributing
------------

TYPO3 CMS core is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to join the project by submitting changes.

A detailed contribution walkthrough can be found at [1].

If you'd like to contribute, please be aware the main git repository is located at [2], all
 changes are processed in our review system at [3]. The GitHub repository [4] is a synchronized
 mirror of the primary git repository and pull requests via GitHub are not supported at the moment.
