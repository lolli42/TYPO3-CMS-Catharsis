Contributing
------------

TYPO3 CMS core is a volunteer effort. We encourage you to join the project by submitting changes.

Have a look at our [detailed contribution walkthrough][1].

If you'd like to contribute, please use the [main git repository][2], all changes are
 processed in our [review system][3]. The [GitHub repository][4] is a synchronized
 mirror of the primary git repository and pull requests via GitHub are not supported at the moment.
