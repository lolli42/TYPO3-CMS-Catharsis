TYPO3.CMS-Catharsis
===================

Vision / Catharsis fork of TYPO3 CMS

This is an integration, sandbox, vision and incubator fork of TYPO3 CMS aiming to get bigger things done more quickly. Patches merged to mainline are regularily merged to this fork, so the systems do not diverge too much.

The following mainline changes evolved here and were committed upstream:
* Removal of statictemplates extension
* TCA bootstrap refactoring
* System environment check in install tool.
* Major rewrite of install tool
* Major FormEngine refactoring
