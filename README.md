TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system released
under the GNU GPL. TYPO3 is copyright (c) 1999-2015 by Kasper Skaarhoj.

This is an integration, sandbox, vision and incubator fork of TYPO3 CMS aiming to get bigger things done more quickly. Patches merged to mainline are regularily merged to this this fork, so the systems do not diverge too much.

The following mainline changes evolved here and were committed upstream:
* Removal of statictemplates extension
* TCA bootstrap refactoring
* System environment check in install tool.
* Major rewrite of install tool
* Major FormEngine refactoring
